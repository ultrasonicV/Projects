** During my internship in 2019, I rebuilt and modernized an Elementary School's network. The backbone topology consisted of 5 layer 3 switches, 6 APs, 2 Servers and a Router.
The entire project lasted for around 2 months, this included the evaluation, planning, rollout and documentation of the network.

** I carried out the entire renovation of my apartment myself, except from the in-wall plumbing and the main circuit breaker replacement.  
The bathroom and kitchen were the biggest challenges.
